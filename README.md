##**Overlap2dRuntime**

The Overlap2dRuntime provides functionality to load, manipulate and render scenes generated by [Overlap2D](http://overlap2d.com/).

##**Setup**

2. If you have don't have Gradle Eclipse plugin you can go [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/eclipse-integration-gradle) 
3. Using Eclipse Grdale plugin, import the project by choosing File -> Import -> Gradle -> Gradle project.

For alternative or other IDEs you will need to create a new project and import the source.
Or you can just copy all sources to your project.

##Note

Please note that [Overlap2D](http://overlap2d.com/) is in development and this runtime is for test purposes.
While sources might stay same, architecture will definitely change.
Also you can try to write your own runtime based on this.
